# Technical Infrastructure for the LAK Hackathon 2018

## Support Materials
There is a [separate general-purpose Learning Analytics Hackathon Support Material repository](https://github.com/LAK-Hackathon/Support-Materials), which contains materials not specific to a given hackathon event. (This is a fork of a repository created by Michael Webb from Jisc)


## Activity Data Generation
Tribal has made its prototype [activity data generator available as a GitHub repository](https://github.com/Tribal-LA/activity-data-generator). This is an early stage development, for use to generate testing and demonstration data, which can simulate various patterns of behaviour for different stereotype student and group types. This has been established with an Open Source licence.
